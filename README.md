# Jotter Note-Taking Application

## Project Overview
Jotter Note-Taking is a web-based application developed as part of a project exhibition at VIT Bhopal University. The primary objective of this project is to improve note-taking by leveraging Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to convert handwritten or printed text into digital notes.

## Motivation
The motivation behind Jotter Note-Taking was to address the challenge of manually transcribing handwritten notes into digital formats. By automating this process, students can efficiently digitize their notes from books, lecture slides, or handwritten documents, making them easier to organize and reference.

## Features
- **OCR-Based Note Conversion**: Users can upload images of handwritten or printed text, which is then converted into editable digital notes.
- **User Authentication**: Basic sign-up and sign-in functionality implemented using PHP.
- **Minimalistic UI**: A simple and user-friendly interface designed for ease of use.
- **Integration with Gemini AI**: Optional feature to summarize notes using Gemini AI.
- **Streamlit Integration**: Utilizes Python-based OCR functionality via Streamlit.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Implementation**: Helps connect notes and improve content organization.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: PHP (for authentication and database interactions)
- **OCR Processing**: Python (integrated using Streamlit)
- **AI Summarization**: Gemini AI

## Future Enhancements
- Improved UI with additional styling and animations.
- voice to text note taking
- Using advanced frameworks like reactjs for 
- Support for multiple languages in OCR.
- Advanced AI-based content structuring.
- Cloud-based storage integration for better accessibility.
